# Linux Shell Scripting

 Shell is an environment provided for user interaction and executes commands read from the standard input device.
 Bash ( Bourne-Again Shell ) its open source and mostly in linux.
 Features are :
 
    Variables - they hold value given.
    Positional parameters - keywords act as a command to execute something special.
    Exit status - its relayed upon exit to output success/failure.
    Conditional statements - " if " and conditions.
    Loops - write loops ; for, while e.t.c
    Functions - function which looks like a script within scripts.
    Logical and Arithmetic Operators.
    
Here am going to use those features to create basic bash shell scripts fro educational purposes.
